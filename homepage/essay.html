         <h1 class="essay">"Beauty of Pelham Park"</h1>
         <div class="a">
         <p>In 1654, Englishman Thomas Pell bought 50,000 acres of land from the Siwanoy. This land has been the site of many events in American history, such as serving as a buffer between British-held Manhattan and rebel-held Westchester. Later on, the Pell family sold most of the land with Robert Bartow buying the remainder. He built the historic Bartow-Pell Mansion, which stands today as a museum. Pelham Bay Park, which is named after Pell, became a park when in 1988, the New York State legislature created a Bronx parks system after years of advocacy from the New York Park Association. The constant exchange between parties allowed the park to exist.</p>
         <p>I define a park as a public place where family and friends can gather to do whatever they choose. There are so many different opportunities and choices in a park to be active, express yourself, and spend time doing what you like. To me Pelham Bay Park is the best local park to be active and have an enjoyable experience. Because of its sheer size, there is never a shortage of what to do. Whether you want to ride your bike on the miles of bike trails, or try a new sport like bocce, there is never a dull moment in Pelham Bay. </p>
         <p>The park is usually populated with all kinds of people doing different things. There are private instructors hosting gym classes, people running on the tracks, and kids riding their bikes. The park is the largest in NYC with miles of hiking trails, a 13-mile saltwater shoreline, numerous fields and courts, and a diverse wildlife. It is very open and spacious with tons of trees and green thick grass. There are usually parking spots near or inside the park, but on busy days like Saturday, it can be hard to find one. The variety and massive size of the park allow endless days of exploring and trying something new.</p>
         <p>I started going to Pelham Bay Park whensince I was a toddler with my parents to spend the afternoon on the benches and enjoying the breeze. As I grew older I continued to go frequently to the park and find more meaningful experiences there. I rode bikes with my brother, played soccer with my cousin, and had picnics with relatives. But I remember the park because it was the place for me to be active after staying home all day. It was the park I always went to because of its close location but also because of its space and environment. </p>

         <p>One of my valuable memories from the park is when my cousin and her family caome from Ohio to my house for vacation. We went to Pelham Bay for an afternoon and I spent the day playing with my nephew and brother. My nephew ran around on the rope bridges and playground floor while my brother and I chased him around. It is one of the earliest and most memorable experiences I had with my nephew. There was also the moment when my brother and I were playing soccer and two strangers came up to us to ask to play. I wanted to refuse but I had no idea how to do it without seeming rude, so I let them play. We all had a fun time together, which would not have been possible without the variety of people at Pelham Bay Park.</p>
         <p>Pelham Bay Park is one park that is combined with the features of many attractions. Some popular visiting spots are the beach, museum, courts and fields, bike trails, and childrenâ€™s playground. The park has different parts to it which make it more interesting and keep people returning. It has a historical side with the museums, statues, and monuments that can be explored to better understand the foundations and past of the park. But it also has the side where people can come to play sports and spend time with friends. Each experience and perspective shapes how you see the park. Someone who is more interested in the history of places would be more interested in the Bartow-Pell Museum Mansion rather than someone who is athletic and enjoys the outdoors. However, the beauty of the park is that it has something to offer to everyone.</p>
